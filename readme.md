## Development
Wanna help polish this turd? Sweet! This package is built using shadow-cljs to make development easier supporting both:

- Hot code reloading. As you change the plugin's code, it will be dynamically reloaded so there's no need to refresh Atom.
- A full ClojureScript REPL into Atom, so you can REPL into the package and even inspect objects inside Atom.

### Install Shadow CJLS
First, install the Shadow CLJS node package somewhere on your $PATH:

```
npm install shadow-cljs
```

Next, in Atom open a test project directory in Dev Mode. You can do this from the menu by going to View -> Developer -> Open In Dev Mode. This allows Shadow CLJS to connect into Atom's JS runtime.

### Compiling our CLJS, reloading and REPLing into the package

1. Compile using one of the methods below:

	To compile with an auto code-reloading loop with REPL, use:

	```
	shadow-cljs watch app
	```

	To compile without a code-reloading loop, use:

	```
	shadow-cljs compile app
	```

	To compile for release with `:simple` optimizations, use:

	```
	shadow-cljs release app
	```


2. REPL into the running project:

	From a different terminal, run:

	```
	$ shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
	```

	This will connect you directly into the plugin, so you can live develop it. You can exit the REPL by typing `:repl/quit`

	Once we add CLJS support, you'll be able to REPL into the package using itself. üêµ


### Link the plugin to Atom

After you have compiled the plugin, go into the `plugin/` folder and run

```
apm install
apm link
```

You can now use clojure-repl plugin inside Atom as you develop it inside Atom!


In order to export functions to be used as Atom commands, add them to `:exports` inside `shadow-cljs.edn` like this:

```
:foo clojure-repl.core/foo
:bar clojure-repl.core/bar
```

## Roadmap

### Core features
- [] Support for Boot
- [] Support connecting into remote Socket REPLs
- [] ClojureScript support
- [] Unrepl support
	By default, support nREPL, but all advanced features like type ahead information, getting docstrings and namespace reflection will only work with unrepl. First class nREPL support only extends to executing commands and generating great stacktraces.
- [] Add line number and file metadata to stacktraces.

### Pair programming / Teletype support
- [] Use Teletype to send messages between the host and guest.
- [] Sync the REPL history between the host and the guest.
- [] Find a better way to link the REPL editors between the host and guest. Right now they are just linked by the title like ‚ÄúREPL Entry‚Äù, but this limits us to just 1 REPL over Teletype at a time.
- [] Find a way to gracefully open both the input-editor and output-editor (history) editors at once on the guest‚Äôs side when the host clicks in either one. For example trick Teletype to sending both editors over to the guest at the same time.

### Using multiple REPLs at once support
- [] When executing code from a file, find which project the file is in, and run the code in the REPL that corresponds to that project. Otherwise, fall back to the last used REPL. How can we do this on the guest side which doesn't have access to all the files?
- [] Add the project name to the title of the REPL editors
- [] If multiple REPLs are open, instead of choosing a REPL by project, add an option to execute code in the REPL that is currently visible in the editor. For example, if you have multiple REPLs tabs open, it will choose the one that's visible and not in the background. Or if multiple REPLs are visible on screen (or all of them not on screen) fall back to the last recently used REPL.

### User interface improvements
- [] Create a new kind of Pane which holds both the REPL input-editor and output-editor.
- [] Add buttons to REPL Pane like "Execute" and "Clear history".
- [] Make the "Execute" button dynamically switch to "Cancel" when a long running command is executed (this should work seamlessly on the guest side too).
- [] Create a custom Atom grammar for the REPL history editor, ideally this would draw horizontal lines between each REPL entry.
- [] Make the output-editor (history) read-only.

### OS support
- [] Linux support, definitely.
- [] Windows support, probably not going to do it. PRs welcome.

### Polish
- [] Add support for multiple Atom projects. When starting a REPL either start it in the project for the current file, or prompt the user and ask which file.
- [] Update the our namespace detection regex to allow for all valid characters in a namespace: include $=<>_
- [] Only allow one command to execute at a time. If we execute code in the REPL, either from a file or directly from the input-editor, it should show a spinner in the REPL UI and ignore the command.
- [] Compile out a release version with advanced optimizations and all of the REPL/dynamic reloading shadow-cljs features turned off.

### Errors
- [] Fix error ‚ÄúPane has been destroyed at Pane.activate‚Äù when REPL TextEditor is the only item in a Pane.
- [] Fix error ‚ÄúTypeError: Patch does not apply at DefaultHistoryProvider.module.exports.DefaultHistoryProvider.getSnapshot <- TextBuffer.module.exports.TextBuffer.getHistory‚Äù

### Possible future ideas
- [] Stop multiplexing stdout/stderr and REPL results through the output-editor (history). Add a 3rd collapsable editor which
is dedicated to stdout/stderr. Additionally, add an option to
hook into all stdout/err streams on a remote socket REPL, so
all output can be seen even from other threads.
- [] Show results next to the code in the file that generated them like proto-repl.
- [] Sayid debugging support
- [] The ability to add breakpoints or wrap seamless print statements around blocks of code. These would be a first-class UI feature, imagine a purple box wrapped around code that would print it out, every time
